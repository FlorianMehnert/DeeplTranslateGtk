# Translator using Deepl Api

- to use this tranlator you need a Deepl account with at least the free plan (you will be able to translate up to
  500.000 characters per month)
- using this also requires GTK 3.0 ... make sure to set it up :)
- tested on Ubuntu 22.04

## Usage

If you want to be convenient just set up your own hotkey for the deepl_translation.py in your custom
keybindings: `python3 PATH_TO_deepl_translation.py` (using the gnome GUI)

1. (optional: copy something to your clipboard)
2. start the script
3. (optional: replace the text in the Entry)
4. <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to start translating
5. <kbd>ENTER</kbd> again to close the Entry which should now contain the translated text
